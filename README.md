## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/manifest-v2-2/#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ✅ | arm64v8-\<version tag\> |

## Application Setup

The application can be accessed at:

* https://yourhost:3001/

### Strict reverse proxies

This image uses a self-signed certificate by default. This naturally means the scheme is `https`.
If you are using a reverse proxy which validates certificates, you need to [disable this check for the container](https://docs.linuxserver.io/faq#strict-proxy).

**Modern GUI desktop apps may have compatibility issues with the latest Docker syscall restrictions. You can use Docker with the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` setting to allow these syscalls on hosts with older Kernels or libseccomp versions.**

### Security

>[!WARNING]
>This container provides privileged access to the host system. Do not expose it to the Internet unless you have secured it properly.

**HTTPS is required for full functionality.** Modern browser features such as WebCodecs, used for video and audio, will not function over an insecure HTTP connection.

By default, this container has no authentication. The optional `CUSTOM_USER` and `PASSWORD` environment variables enable basic HTTP auth, which is suitable only for securing the container on a trusted local network. For internet exposure, we strongly recommend placing the container behind a reverse proxy, such as [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag), with a robust authentication mechanism.

The web interface includes a terminal with passwordless `sudo` access. Any user with access to the GUI can gain root control within the container, install arbitrary software, and probe your local network.

### Options in all Selkies-based GUI containers

This container is based on [Docker Baseimage Selkies](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-selkies), which provides the following environment variables and run configurations to customize its functionality.

#### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `CUSTOM_PORT` | Internal HTTP port. Defaults to `3000`. |
| `CUSTOM_HTTPS_PORT` | Internal HTTPS port. Defaults to `3001`. |
| `CUSTOM_WS_PORT` | Internal port the container listens on for websockets if it needs to be swapped from the default 8082. |
| `CUSTOM_USER` | Username for HTTP Basic Auth. Defaults to `abc`. |
| `PASSWORD` | Password for HTTP Basic Auth. If unset, authentication is disabled. |
| `SUBFOLDER` | Application subfolder for reverse proxy configurations. Must include leading and trailing slashes, e.g., `/subfolder/`. |
| `TITLE` | Page title displayed in the web browser. Defaults to "Selkies". |
| `START_DOCKER` | If set to `false`, the privileged Docker-in-Docker setup will not start automatically. |
| `DISABLE_IPV6` | Set to `true` to disable IPv6 support in the container. | 
| `LC_ALL` | Sets the container's locale, e.g., `fr_FR.UTF-8`. |
| `DRINODE` | If mounting in /dev/dri for DRI3 GPU Acceleration allows you to specify the device to use IE `/dev/dri/renderD128` |
| `NO_DECOR` | If set, applications will run without window borders, suitable for PWA usage. |
| `NO_FULL` | If set, applications will not be automatically fullscreened. |
| `DISABLE_ZINK` | If set, Zink-related environment variables will not be configured when a video card is detected. |
| `WATERMARK_PNG` | Full path to a watermark PNG file inside the container, e.g., `/usr/share/selkies/www/icon.png`. |
| `WATERMARK_LOCATION` | Integer specifying the watermark location: `1` (Top Left), `2` (Top Right), `3` (Bottom Left), `4` (Bottom Right), `5` (Centered), `6` (Animated). |

#### Optional Run Configurations

| Argument | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `--privileged` | Starts a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) environment. For better performance, mount the Docker data directory from the host, e.g., `-v /path/to/docker-data:/var/lib/docker`. |
| `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` | Mounts the host's Docker socket to manage host containers from within this container. |
| `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri` | Mount a GPU into the container, this can be used in conjunction with the `DRINODE` environment variable to leverage a host video card for GPU accelerated applications. Only **Open Source** drivers are supported IE (Intel,AMDGPU,Radeon,ATI,Nouveau) |

### Language Support - Internationalization

To launch the desktop session in a different language, set the `LC_ALL` environment variable. For example:

*   `-e LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8` - Chinese
*   `-e LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8` - Japanese
*   `-e LC_ALL=ko_KR.UTF-8` - Korean
*   `-e LC_ALL=ar_AE.UTF-8` - Arabic
*   `-e LC_ALL=ru_RU.UTF-8` - Russian
*   `-e LC_ALL=es_MX.UTF-8` - Spanish (Latin America)
*   `-e LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8` - German
*   `-e LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8` - French
*   `-e LC_ALL=nl_NL.UTF-8` - Netherlands
*   `-e LC_ALL=it_IT.UTF-8` - Italian

### DRI3 GPU Acceleration

For accelerated apps or games, render devices can be mounted into the container and leveraged by applications using:

`--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri`

This feature only supports **Open Source** GPU drivers:

| Driver | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| Intel | i965 and i915 drivers for Intel iGPU chipsets |
| AMD | AMDGPU, Radeon, and ATI drivers for AMD dedicated or APU chipsets |
| NVIDIA | nouveau2 drivers only, closed source NVIDIA drivers lack DRI3 support |

The `DRINODE` environment variable can be used to point to a specific GPU.

DRI3 will work on aarch64 given the correct drivers are installed inside the container for your chipset.

### Nvidia GPU Support

**Note: Nvidia support is not available for Alpine-based images.**

Nvidia GPU support is available by leveraging Zink for OpenGL. When a compatible Nvidia GPU is passed through, it will also be **automatically utilized for hardware-accelerated video stream encoding** (using the `x264enc` full-frame profile), significantly reducing CPU load.

Enable Nvidia support with the following runtime flags:

| Flag | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `--gpus all` | Passes all available host GPUs to the container. This can be filtered to specific GPUs. |
| `--runtime nvidia` | Specifies the Nvidia runtime, which provides the necessary drivers and tools from the host. |

For Docker Compose, you must first configure the Nvidia runtime as the default on the host:

```
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Then, assign the GPU to the service in your `compose.yaml`:

```
services:
  obsidian:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [compute,video,graphics,utility]
```

### Application Management

There are two methods for installing applications inside the container: PRoot Apps (recommended for persistence) and Native Apps.

#### PRoot Apps (Persistent)

Natively installed packages (e.g., via `apt-get install`) will not persist if the container is recreated. To retain applications and their settings across container updates, we recommend using [proot-apps](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps). These are portable applications installed to the user's persistent `$HOME` directory.

To install an application, use the command line inside the container:

```
proot-apps install filezilla
```

A list of supported applications is available [here](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-apps).

#### Native Apps (Non-Persistent)

You can install packages from the system's native repository using the [universal-package-install](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/universal-package-install) mod. This method will increase the container's start time and is not persistent. Add the following to your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
  environment:
    - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-package-install
    - INSTALL_PACKAGES=libfuse2|git|gdb
```

## Usage

To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.

>[!NOTE]
>Unless a parameter is flaged as 'optional', it is *mandatory* and a value must be provided.

### docker-compose (recommended, [click here for more info](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

```yaml
---
services:
  obsidian:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest
    container_name: obsidian
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 3001:3001
    shm_size: "1gb"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=obsidian \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  --shm-size="1gb" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest
```

## Parameters

Containers are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 3000:3000` | Obsidian desktop gui HTTP, must be proxied. |
| `-p 3001:3001` | Obsidian desktop gui HTTPS. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Etc/UTC` | specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |
| `-v /config` | Users home directory in the container, stores program settings and files. |
| `--shm-size=` | This is needed for electron applications to function properly. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__MYVAR=/run/secrets/mysecretvariable
```

Will set the environment variable `MYVAR` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretvariable` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id your_user` as below:

```bash
id your_user
```

Example output:

```text
uid=1000(your_user) gid=1000(your_user) groups=1000(your_user)
```

[![Docker Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?color=94398d&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&label=obsidian&query=%24.mods%5B%27obsidian%27%5D.mod_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinuxserver%2Fdocker-mods%2Fmaster%2Fmod-list.yml)](https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=obsidian "view available mods for this container.") [![Docker Universal Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?color=94398d&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&label=universal&query=%24.mods%5B%27universal%27%5D.mod_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinuxserver%2Fdocker-mods%2Fmaster%2Fmod-list.yml)](https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=universal "view available universal mods.")

We publish various [Docker Mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods) to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above.

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it obsidian /bin/bash
    ```

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f obsidian
    ```

* Container version number:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' obsidian
    ```

* Image version number:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest
    ```

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (noted in the relevant readme.md), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update images:
    * All images:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull
        ```

    * Single image:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull obsidian
        ```

* Update containers:
    * All containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

    * Single container:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d obsidian
        ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image:

    ```bash
    docker pull lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest
    ```

* Stop the running container:

    ```bash
    docker stop obsidian
    ```

* Delete the container:

    ```bash
    docker rm obsidian
    ```

* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

>[!TIP]
>We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-obsidian.git
cd docker-obsidian
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t lscr.io/linuxserver/obsidian:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware and vice versa using `lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.
